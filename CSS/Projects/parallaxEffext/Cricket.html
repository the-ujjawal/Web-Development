            <p class="txt">
                Indian cricket is one of the most celebrated sports cultures in the world, uniting millions with passion
                and pride. Governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), it has produced legendary
                players like Sachin Tendulkar, Kapil Dev, MS Dhoni, and Virat Kohli. Cricket in India goes beyond just a
                game—it’s an emotion, deeply rooted in the country’s identity. India’s national team has won multiple
                ICC trophies, including the 1983 and 2011 Cricket World Cups, the 2007 T20 World Cup, and the 2013
                Champions Trophy. The Indian Premier League (IPL) has further revolutionized the sport, offering a
                global platform for emerging talent. Street cricket, school tournaments, and domestic leagues feed this
                massive ecosystem, making India one of the most dominant forces in world cricket today.

            <p class="txt">
                Sachin Tendulkar, often called the "God of Cricket," is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in
                cricket history. Born on April 24, 1973, in Mumbai, he debuted for India at just 16. Over his 24-year
                international career, he amassed 100 international centuries and over 34,000 runs. Known for his
                impeccable technique, discipline, and humility, Tendulkar inspired generations of cricketers. He played
                key roles in many Indian victories, including the 2011 World Cup win. Beyond records, his dedication and
                sportsmanship made him a national icon. Tendulkar retired in 2013, leaving behind an unparalleled legacy
                in the world of cricket.

                revolutionized India’s limited-overs approach with his finishing skills and strategic thinking. Known as
                “Captain Cool,” he nurtured young talent and built a fearless, balanced team. Dhoni is celebrated for
                his helicopter shot and match-winning chases. Retiring from international cricket in 2020, he continues
                inspiring millions with his leadership and sportsmanship.

                the top ICC Test ranking. Nicknamed the “Run Machine,” Kohli is admired for his chasing ability, intense
                passion, and work ethic. Beyond cricket, he promotes fitness and philanthropy. With numerous centuries
                to his name, Kohli remains one of India’s most influential athletes, symbolizing determination,
                self-belief, and relentless pursuit of excellence.
